# BUILDX — Electrical & Plumbing Supplies

This repository contains a small static website for BUILDX, a local supplier of electrical and plumbing products in Badiadka, Kasaragod, Kerala.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — Main responsive website markup (HTML5).
- `styles.css` — Primary stylesheet (CSS3, mobile-first).
- `script.js` — Frontend JavaScript for navigation, WhatsApp integration and UI behaviors.
- `buildx.mp4` — Product/showcase video used in the hero/video section.
- `logo.png`, `x_icon.png`, `x_icon_no_bg.png` — Brand assets used across the site.
- `BUILDX BUSINESS CARD.pdf` — Original business card reference the site was rebuilt from.

## Quick start (local preview)
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with).
2. The site is static — no build step required.

## WhatsApp contact
- The Contact section contains a WhatsApp action button that opens a prefilled message using `https://api.whatsapp.com/send`.
- Pop-up blockers may prevent a new tab from opening; the site falls back to a redirect.

## Recommended edits
- Update `meta` tags in `index.html` for SEO (title, description, canonical URL).
- Replace `buildx.mp4` with optimized video or a thumbnail for faster loading.
- Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to share this project publicly.

## Deployment
- Deploy to any static host: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel or your webserver. Copy the repository files to the server root.

## Developer notes
- No package manager or build tooling is required.
- For changes, edit the HTML/CSS/JS files directly. Use modern browsers for best compatibility.

## Contact
- For help updating or customizing this site, open an issue or contact the repository owner.
